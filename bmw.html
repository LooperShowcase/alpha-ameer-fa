      The 2022 BMW M4 is just as exciting as its M3 sedan sibling, but only it's available
       as a coupe or soft-top convertible. Both make our Editors' Choice list. T
       he base hard-top model comes exclusively with rear-wheel drive, a satisfying
        manual transmission, and a thrilling 473-hp twin-turbo straight-six. 
        The Competition variant gets an enhanced 503-hp engine, a snappy automatic gearbox
        , and unique chassis tuning that should culminate in quicker lap times at the local
        
        racetrack. Only the automatic M4 is available with all-wheel drive, and this slick 
        system features a drift-worthy rear-drive mode. Regardless of the body style or 
        power delivery, the M4 is a hoot to hoon, and its ride is remarkably civil when
         hunting apexes isn't part of the daily commute. We wish BMW gave it analog gauges
         instead of indecipherable digital ones, and we'd prefer fewer adjustable drive-mode settings,
          but overall the 2022 M4 is delightful to drive, and that's what matters.
