      1.m4 comption : As the two-door version of the M3 sedan, the M4 has high
      levels of comfort, luxury, and daily usability—and a reasonably roomy rear
      seat should you need them. Power and grip are two areas where the BMW M4
      shines. The standard M4 comes with rear-wheel drive, a six-speed manual
      transmission, and a fiery 473-hp twin-turbo inline-six engine; M4
      Competition models have 503 horsepower. Both models can be had with an
      optional eight-speed automatic, the only transmission sold with the
      optional xDrive all-wheel-drive system. There’s even a new track-attack
      version, the 543-hp M4 CSL that deletes the rear seat for weight savings.
      An overwhelming number of driving modes that control powertrain-and
      -chassis configurability complicate finding a setup you’re happy with.
      That complaint aside, the M4 is one special automobile. Lots of power,
      tons of torque, and an available manual transmission remind us of what
      made M cars so damn good a long time ago.

2.m2 comption The BMW M2 excites and delights with the skillset of a classical
 high-performance sports car – reproduced in highly concentrated form, more intensive
 than ever and cutting-edge technology. With its compact dimensions, an inline-6-cylinder engine,
 a manual gearbox, rear-wheel drive and an advanced operating concept, the M automobile
 encapsulates the pure joy of driving. At the heart of the BMW M2 are fleet-footed agility on demand
 and handling that remains easily controllable even as the driver explores the coupé’s limits.

    3.x7 When it comes to moving an affluent family, there's no better BMW than the X7,
     the brand's luxurious three-row SUV. While its cargo area and rearmost seats aren't 
     as spacious as rivals such as the Jeep Grand Wagoneer and Mercedes-Benz GLS-class, 
     the Bimmer boasts better driving manners as well as an impressive selection of 
     engines. They range from a 375-hp turbo-six to a 523-hp twin-turbo V-8, with the
      latter making 630 horses on the highest-class, max-performance Alpina XB7. All 
      models have all-wheel drive and an adaptive air suspension that promotes a 
      pillow-like ride. The 2023 X7's interior is serene, but it's also packed with
       upscale materials and modern tech such as the dash's giant curved glass display.
        Those features, combined with the X7's towing capability and an array of standard
         active-safety tech, make the biggest BMW one of the best.
